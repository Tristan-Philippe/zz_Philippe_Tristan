I hope to deepen my understanding of R and github so that I can analyse RNA sequencing data. At first this would involve simply statistical processing, sorting genes into categories based on stress response, and making figures. I would also like to go further and explore other means of data interpretation available such as sorting genes into functional groups and using correlations to identify new genes that are involved in coordinating stress response which could then be tested.

This repository is for course work related to STAT540.
